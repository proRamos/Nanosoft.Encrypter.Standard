## About this library
Nanosoft.Encrypter is a symmetric key that operates on 64-bit blocks of information and uses 128-bit keys.
Nanosoft.Encrypter generates a unique key by itself every time it is executed, excluding the supply of the same.
The algorithm used works differently, as it uses confusion and diffusion to encrypt the text. In practice, it uses four algebraic groups with mixed operations, and that's how Nanosoft.Encrypter manages to protect information.
